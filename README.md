## Comptetive Programming Archive

This repository stores all codes that I used while learning algorithms and data structures.
It contains two parts - 
1. Basics
2. Contest Codes

### Basics
This repo contains all the basic implementation of data structures that I learnt.
Most of them have been coded with the help of geeksforgeeks

### Contest Codes
This repo contains codes of the few contest that I took part in codeforces.
